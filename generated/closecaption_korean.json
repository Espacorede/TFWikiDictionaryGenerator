Furthermore, once a team was reduced to defending a single control point, the stronger attacking team was often unable to successfully assault the final point for the full capture period, which caused too many games to end in a stalemate.

If the gun was too weak, the Engineer would have no chance against skilled players, effectively eliminating any reason to build it in the first place. Our solution was to make the sentrygun essentially binary in the sense that it's lethal to opponents who don't take cover, but can't intelligently deal with enemies popping in and out of cover.

To meet players' expectations, a sniper rifle has to be able to kill an opponent with a single shot to the head. On the flip side, we need to ensure it can't be snap fired from the hip with the same effect, because then, in the hands of an experienced player, it also becomes the game's most lethal short range weapon, negating the Sniper's primary weakness. To solve this, we implemented a charging damage meter that only appears when the sniper is zoomed. This solution has several beneficial side effects: \nThe low damage both while un-zoomed and at the initial zoom ensures that Snipers can't kill opponents with impromptu snap fire. The charge time means Snipers can deal out low damage shots quickly or highly damaging shots at slow intervals, which allows opponents to overwhelm them with a coordinated rush. The high damage at the end of the charge rewards Sniper-esque behaviors, such as locating a decent vantage point and taking very deliberate shots.\n", "#commentary\tf2-Comment021.mp3": "[Marc Scaparro] \ud30c\uc774\ub85c\ub294 \uadfc\uc811 \uc804\ud22c\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubcd1\uacfc\ub85c, \uc2b5\uaca9 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub514\uc790\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\ub85c\uac00 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud30c\uc774\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ub41c \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ud1b5\ub85c\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544\ub2e4\ub140\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc811\uadfc\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\ub85c\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac15\ub825\ud574\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \ud654\uc5fc \ubc29\uc0ac\uae30\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub300\ubc29\uc758 \uc2dc\uc57c\ub97c \ud750\ub9ac\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud654\uc5fc\uc5d0 \ud729\uc2f8\uc778 \uc801\uc740 \ubd88\ud0c0 \uc8fd\uc744 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc783\uace0 \ud5e4\ub9ec \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment021.mp3": "[Marc Scaparro] The Pyro is designed to be the best short-range combat class, aimed at encouraging players to adopt an ambush style of play.

When an invulnerable Medic & his friend come running in, it's an extreme high point for them.  It's also a rush for the defenders, who know they've just got to hold on for 10 seconds until invulnerability fades.  Invulnerability also sharpens pacing by helping a team push through a defensive stalemate, when the enemy team turtles up and refuses to come out of their base.  Without a lack of defensive skirmishers, it's easier for the offense to build up the invulnerability charge without interruption.  In addition, invulnerability is a great goal for the Medic and rewards him for being an effective healer.

With most multiplayer maps, you know what you'll be doing before the map has even finished loading.  In our case, we wanted a map where you couldn't predict even something as basic as your starting point, let alone what you would be doing when you got there.  Hydro therefore begins with a randomized starting state.  The emphasis on control of constantly shifting territories means the map rarely feels repetitive.

This is only really of interest to those who are near the top.  With TF2 we decided that a better approach might be to compare stats to the player's previous successes, turning them from a worldwide comparative system into a personalized motivational one. The beginning player gets encouragement and acknowledgement that while they're not highly skilled yet, they're getting better all the time. The veterans get to see when they've managed to come close to their previous record, which encourages them beat that record.  The personal stat system also acts as a validation system. When a player feels like they've had a really good run, the stats system pops up and essentially says, 'You're right, that was a great run.'", "#commentary\tf2-Comment029.mp3": "[Andrea Wicklund] \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uc774 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ub420\uc218\ub85d \uac8c\uc784 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc124\uba85\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\ucc3d\uae30\uc758 \ud300\ud3ec2\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ud750\ub97c\uc218\ub85d \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubcd1\uacfc \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6e0\uc73c\uba70 \ucd1d\uc54c \uc774\uc678\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0ac\uccb4\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ubb34\uae30\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uae30\ub3c4 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6e0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud56d \uc138\ub825\uc774 \ubcc4\ub85c \uba40\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacf3\uc5d0 \uc11c\ub85c\uc758 \uae30\uc9c0\ub97c \uac74\uc124\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\ub3c4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \ub2e4\ub978 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc131\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc804\ud600 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac70\uad6c\uc758 \ud5e4\ube44\ub97c \uc65c\uc18c\ud55c \uccb4\uad6c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774 \uc606\uc5d0 \ub193\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774 \ub458\uc758 \uccb4\ub825\uacfc \uc2f8\uc6b0\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc804\ud600 \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc14\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ub515\uc774 \uce58\ub8cc \ub300\uc0c1\uc5d0\uac8c \uce58\ub8cc \uad11\uc120\uc744 \ube44\ucd9c \ub54c \ube68\uac04\uc0c9 \uc2ed\uc790\uac00 \uae30\ud638\uac00 \ud568\uaed8 \ud758\ub7ec\uac00\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc790 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc740 \uadf8 \uad11\uc120\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ud300\uc758 \uae30\uc9c0\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \uc778\uc811\ud574 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub3c4 \uac00\uc0c1\uc758 \uc138\uacc4\uad00\uc73c\ub85c \uc27d\uac8c \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ud300\ud3ec2 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7\uc740 \uc27d\uac8c \uc54c\uc544\ucc28\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \ub2e4\ub978 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ud63c\ub3d9\ub420 \uc5fc\ub824\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment029.mp3": "[Andrea Wicklund] The more your art direction can use well-understood visual representations, the less work you have to do to explain your game elements. The earliest version of TF2 had a heavily realistic art direction. As time went on, we found this was causing us a lot of issues.  The differences between our player classes were hard to expose satisfactorily.  Weapons firing anything other than bullets were hard to visualize.  Our maps didn't make a lot of sense in the real world, where two opposing forces rarely build bases within fifty feet of one another.  In addition, the game wasn't visually distinct from our other products.  A stylized world had none of these problems:  Put the massive Heavy next to the pinstripe-suited Spy, and players understand both the numerical health differences between the classes and their very different gameplay styles.  The medic's healing beam was easily understood by playtesters when they saw the floating red plus symbols streaming into the target.  A stylized fiction can easily explain why the team's bases are built right next to each other.

We developed a read hierarchy for player models, prioritizing the information that players needed to be able to read merely by looking at the model.  Our hierarchy was this: first, what team they're on, second, what class they're playing, and third, what weapon they're wielding.  Team readability was addressed by adopting an overall color palette for each team, picking warm colors for Red and cool colors for Blu.  Class readability was addressed through the character's silhouette. Unique silhouette and animation shapes are more identifiable at far distances, and across a broader range of light levels, than any amount of other visual detail on the model. Finally, the weapon was highlighted through the textures. The areas of highest contrast, which attracts player's eyes, are all focused around the chest area of our character models, right where they hold their weapon. In addition, the subtle gradient from darkness around the character's feet, to the bright areas around the chest, also helps draw the player's eyes to the weapons.", "#commentary\tf2-Comment032.mp3": "[Charlie Brown] \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubcd1\uacfc\ub294 \ud300\ud3ec2 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubcd1\uacfc\uac00 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc778 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \ubb34\uc218\ud788 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcd1\uacfc\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub85c\uc11c \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcd1\uacfc\uc640 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc774\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c \ubcd1\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc9c8\ub9b0 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcd1\uacfc\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub97c \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \ubcd1\uacfc\ub97c \ub460\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2e4\ub825\uacfc \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubc14\uac00 \uc800\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ucd08\ubcf4\uc790\uc640 \uace0\uc218\uac00 \ud568\uaed8 \uc990\uac81\uac8c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \uc131\uaca9\uc774\uac70\ub098, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ube44\ub97c \uc120\ud638\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc2e0\ub098\uac8c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub2e4\ub2c8\uae30\ub97c \uc88b\uc544\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc5d0\uac8c \ub9de\ub294 \ubcd1\uacfc\ub97c \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud300 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc2a4 2\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcd1\uacfc \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc88c\uc6b0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\ud718\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment032.mp3": "[Charlie Brown] Player classes form the backbone of TF2's gameplay.

So what took us so long?  The short answer is that it took us this long to make something we were happy with.  The long answer requires a look at our development process.  At its core is the assumption that we don't really know ahead of time what will be fun.  We know what has been fun in the past.  But if we've got 3 ideas on the table, we can't say for sure which one will be the most fun.  So, we've focused on developing a repeatable process that will find out.  It's based on a cycle of constant iteration, where evaluation is done by watching as many people play the game as possible.  In developing TF2, we tried out many, many features-a few of which made it to the final product, but most of which were cut.  For example, our initial versions of TF2 were focused on trying to build a game around the concept of a commander, a single player who had a real-time-strategy view of the battlefield.  He was responsible for building structures and providing a unifying strategy for the team.  But there were significant design challenges involved.  For instance, how do we design the game such that the commander can have fun, and at same time ensure that the players down on the ground can have fun?  How do we ensure that the players & the commander value the output of the other?  How do we ensure that the game is still fun if you have a terrible commander, or conversely, if you're a great commander with a terrible team?  We spent many months working on these and other issues, and never reached a point where we were satisfied.  In addition, our game had become overly complex, due to our attempts to add a strategy layer deep enough to warrant the addition of the commander in the first place.  In the end, we made the hard decision to remove him from the game and moved on.", "#commentary\tf2-Comment034.mp3": "[Kelly Thornton] \uce58\uba85\ud0c0\ub294 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ucd94\uac00\ub41c \uc694\uc18c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uce58\uba85\ud0c0 \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uce58\uba85\ud0c0 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ub192\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc804\uc138\ub97c \uc870\uae08\uc529 \ubc18\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud788 \ub9d0\ud558\uc790\uba74 \uc804\ud22c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ce\uc740 \ud65c\uc57d\uc744 \ud560\uc218\ub85d \uacc4\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc57d\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ub108 \uba85\uc744 \uc8fd\uc774\ub294 \uadf9\uc801\uc778 \uc21c\uac04\uc774 \uac04\ud639 \uc5f0\ucd9c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment034.mp3": "[Kelly Thornton] Critical hits are one of the features that resulted from our focus on pacing.

Team Fortress 2's focus on unique class roles led us to notice that the standard hand grenade was a more powerful combat decider than some of the primary weapons.  This made the classes more similar in combat-not a desired effect.  In addition, when we looked at some of Team Fortress Classic's map stalemates, they often resulted from large amounts of grenade spam. Two cases were particularly problematic:  That of players throwing grenades repeatedly through doorways, hoping to kill any enemies who might be there, and players on the verge of death throwing all their grenades in rapid succession, hoping to get a kill after they die.  Removing standard hand grenades made the game more fun almost immediately, especially for new players who were often confused as to why they died, when a grenade went off at their feet. When we examined the class-specific grenades, we found similar problems.  Eliminating them from playtests gave us yet another boost in making the game more fun.  Once we'd decided on removal, we analyzed each class to see what capabilities might have been lost as a result of the decision.  In some cases we added other capabilities, where we felt a class had lost the ability to make some interesting decisions, related to its special grenade type.\n", "#commentary\tf2-Comment036.mp3": "[Hamish McKenzie] \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \ub9c9\ubc14\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \ub9c8\ubb34\ub9ac \uc911\uc77c \ub54c \uc77c\uc815\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud574 \ubcf4\ub2c8 \uc544\uc9c1 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud560 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud68c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc \ubb34\uae30\ubcc4 \ub3c4\ubc1c \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \ucd94\uac00 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uac00 \ub098\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud574\ub2f9 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \ud639\uc2dc \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd80\ubd84\uacfc \uc5f0\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744\uc9c0\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70 \ub3c4\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uaca0\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub0b4\ub838\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c4\ubc1c\uc740 \ucc98\uce58\uc790 \ud504\ub9ac\uc988\ucea0\uacfc \uc5b4\uc6b8\ub824\uc11c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uac04\uc758 \uc6d0\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uac01\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5bc\uad74 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ubf50\ub0b4\uae30\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\ud569\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \ub3c4\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud300\ud3ec2 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uac1c\uc131\uc774 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc131\uc6b0\uc758 \uc74c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc644\ubcbd\ud558\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment036.mp3": "[Hamish McKenzie] Late in the project, while other parts of the game were being finished up, we found ourselves with some time left over for extra animation.

They play well with the killer freeze-cam, adding to the relationship between the nemesis and his victim.

In Team Fortress 2, we extended Response Rules to the multiplayer environment for the first time.  The Response Rule system works by listing speech concepts in a simple text file; the game code then makes characters attempt to speak when the rules or conditions defined in the text file are met in the game. For instance, when a player reloads his weapon, this signals the Response Rule system that now would be an appropriate time to speak a line about reloading. The Response Rule system checks the state of the world, and matches it to a set of rules that determine the best line of dialog to use for that speech concept.  If the player's health is low, he may speak a different reloading line than if he is completely healthy.  He could play a special line if he has killed more than two enemies in the last 20 seconds, another set of lines if he's underwater, and so on.  Keeping dialog and rules in script files gives the game's writers the ability to add speech to the game without needing any code support.\n", "#commentary\tf2-Comment038.mp3": "[Moby Francke] \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1 \uc591\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud560 \ub54c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9cc\ud654 \uac19\uc740 \ub290\ub08c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0bd\ud654\uc758 \ubd84\uc704\uae30\ub098 \uac1c\uc131\uc801\uc778 \ub290\ub08c\uc774 \ub098\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uae30\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc885\ub958\uc758 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc74c\uc601\uc120\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c 2D \ud14d\uc2a4\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \uba85\uc554\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud588\uace0 \ubc1d\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uacfc \uc5b4\ub450\uc6b4 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \ub9cc\ub098\ub294 \uacf3\uc5d0\ub294 \ub530\ub73b\ud55c \ub290\ub08c\uc758 \uc0c9\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc54c\ub9de\uc740 \uc74c\uc601 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ud6c4\uc5d0\ub294 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3 \uc120\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc704\uc758 3D \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3cb\ubcf4\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment038.mp3": "[Moby Francke] In our early discussions of rendering styles for the characters, we decided we wanted them to have a look that was illustrative or stylized, without going to the extremes of most toon shaders.

Even the shortlist of essential information is intimidating, including map goals, the whereabouts of their friends, who's shooting them with what weapon, and so on.  We didn't have any way to make all of this information visual, so first we had to prioritize and come up with an essential list of things every player needed to know in order to just have fun.  Information they could learn by playing the game-such as map layout-was of secondary importance; but there was also information, such as the Medic's invulnerability charge, that would be completely invisible unless we exposed it.  We tried to avoid attaching 2D elements to the HUD as much as possible, since we wanted players to be looking at the 3D world we'd built rather than some abstract representation.  For example, players always see their own team's spies as a spy, but they need to know how the spy is disguised to the other team.  We tried a quick hack where we put an icon representing the spy's current disguise floating above his head.  The icon proved baffling to playtesters.   When we tackled the problem by putting cut-out paper masks on the spy, it not only fit the humorous style of the game, but it let players get all pertinent information directly from a quick look at the spy's model, thus keeping them focused on the characters and on the action of the game.  We took this as a lesson, in how holding ourselves to a strong design principle can often force us to come up with better solutions, than if we'd taken the easy route.", "#commentary\tf2-Comment041.mp3": "[Jason Mitchell] \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc900 20\uc138\uae30 \ucd08\uc758 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uc0bd\ud654\uc640 \uc5b4\uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc74c\uc601 \uc591\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \uba85\uc554 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc0bd\ud654 \ub290\ub08c\uc758 \uc74c\uc601 \uc591\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ud300 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc2a4 2\uc758 \ud5e4\ube44\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud5e4\ube44\uc758 \ud314 \uc717\ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \ud53c\ubd80\uc758 \ubc1d\uc740 \uba74\uacfc \uc5b4\ub450\uc6b4 \uba74\uc774 \ubd88\ube5b\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc9c0\ucf1c\ubcf4\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624. \uc9c0\uae08\ucc98\ub7fc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uba85\uc554\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uba85\uc554\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6cc \uc190\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c1\uc811 \uadf8\ub9b0 \uc0bd\ud654\ub9cc\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub290\ub08c\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uba85\uc554 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba85\uc554 \uac04\uc758 \uadf9\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ud300 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc2a4 2\ub9cc\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub8e9\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0bd\ud654 \ub290\ub08c\uc758 \uc74c\uc601\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub610 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc740 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3 \uc120\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3 \uc120\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\uba74 \ubc30\uacbd \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uac00 \uc798 \uad6c\ubd84\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc724\uacfd \uba85\uc554\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc640 \ubc30\uacbd\uc774 \uacb9\uccd0\uc11c \uc798 \uad6c\ubd84\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc608\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud5e4\ube44\uc758 \uc5b4\uae68\uc640 \ubaa9, \uba38\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c0\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc724\uacfd \uba85\uc554\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba74 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uac00 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \ub300\ube44\ub418\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ud300 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc2a4 2\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc591\uc2dd\uacfc\ub3c4 \ub354 \uc798 \uc870\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment041.mp3": "[Jason Mitchell] To achieve a style of character shading which is consistent with the early 20th Century commercial illustrations that influenced our art direction, we alter the diffuse lighting on characters. Here, we can see the Heavy as he appears in Team Fortress 2, using this type of shading style. Note the tight transition between the light and dark sides of the skin on his upper arm. Using a traditional shading model as seen here, the character lighting appears too soft and lacks the distinctive look seen in hand painted illustrations. Our shading model, however, captures the dramatic transition between light and dark and helps to define the unmistakable look of Team Fortress 2. Another facet of illustrative shading is the use of rim highlights to accentuate the silhouettes of characters. Without the rim lighting, the characters tend to blend into the scenery. With the rim lighting, which you can see specifically on the Heavy's shoulders, neck, and head in this example, our characters are visible against the rest of the scene and better fit the art style of Team Fortress 2.", "#commentary\tf2-Comment042.mp3": "[Alden Kroll] 2D HUD \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5c6\uc774 \ubcf4\uae30 \uc88b\uc544\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ub298\ub0a0\uc758 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc640\uc774\ub4dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0 \ub514\uc2a4\ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uac10\uc548\ud560 \ub54c \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub7c9\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ucc98 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ub514\uc2a4\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud300\ud3ec2\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub354\uc6b1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 HUD\uc5d0 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uace1\uc120\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud588\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \uc120\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uadf8\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc170\uc774\ub354 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc740 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ud574\ub3c4 \uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3\uc774 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc170\uc774\ub354 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc724\uacfd \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub099\ud558 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc790\ub3c4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ud45c\uc9c0\ud310\uacfc \uac19\uc740 3D \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. ", "[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment042.mp3": "[Alden Kroll] Two-dimensional HUD elements present a particular art problem, because they have to look good and sharp no matter what resolution the user is running their game at. Given today's availability of high resolution wide-screen displays, this can require a lot of texture memory and a lot of work anticipating different display resolutions. The problem for TF2 was even more daunting because of our desire to include a lot of smooth curved elements in our HUD. We developed a new shader system for drawing 'line art' images.

In previous versions of the Source engine, all particle effects required that custom code be written by the programmers. For Team Fortress 2, we created a system where designers can rapidly create new particle systems and iteratively refine existing ones, without programmer involvement. An in-game editor allows designers to edit the definitions of particle systems and immediately preview effects in the game itself.  The editor also allows artists to connect modular effect 'building blocks' to create complex visual effects.

Complex geometry confuses players, making it hard for them to track enemies, and interfering with their movement and aiming during combat. The most chaotic combat tends to occur when the size of the room fails to support the number of players fighting in it.  In this final area of the map, we wanted a freeform battle to rage for some time before anyone could achieve a decisive victory.  To achieve this, we built a wide open area with several entrances, and gave players a variety of attack and defense options at various heights. Rather than depend on elevators and ladders, we relied on ramps, since these allow freedom of movement at all times instead of confining players.  Through playtesting we made many changes to the dimensions of the room, the size of cover elements, and the size of the entrances, thus ensuring the area could accommodate a battle of many players.

Since the arena is primarily an interior, there wasn't much we could do to alter its basic structure, so we concentrated on careful management of the interior shapes to create an iconic space. The building is essentially a box with big rectangular windows, contrasted by round elements (generators) in the center. To create depth and parallax, we added linear elements such as railings and cables. We used contrasting values of dark and light on the floor, with walkways to create an interesting value pattern. All these elements work together to draw the player's eye to the flag--which must always be the focal point of the arena."}}
